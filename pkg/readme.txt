Todo

- Add equity calcs and column in tsts()?
- coredata: debug it and assignment.. work out eval framework with
  delta, size.at and roll.at
- signals<- needs to call coredata(x)<- 
- states<- needs to call coredata(x)<- (trigger at least an equity re-calc)
- cbind.tsts: write Rd file
- cbind.tsts: column order of return
- cbind.tsts: call coredata<- if column is overwritten?
